Install via ng add. (Recommended)\nIf Angular Material Design is not setup, just run ng add @angular/material learn more\nNow add the library via the angular schematics and everything will be setup for you\nng add @angular-material-extensions/google-maps-autocomplete2. Install via npm. (Alternative)\nNow install @angular-material-extensions/google-maps-autocomplete via:\nnpm install --save @angular-material-extensions/google-maps-autocomplete\n\nRequirements (peer dependencies):\nfor the ui input component, please consider to install the following packages\n\nangular animations v8.x\nangular forms v8.x\nangular material v8.x\nangular cdk v8.x\n\nnpm i @angular/cdk @angular/material @angular/animations @angular/forms \n\nAdditional requirements Theme (Material Design)\n\nangular material theme\n\n\nSystemJS\n\nNote:If you are using SystemJS, you should adjust your configuration to point to the UMD bundle.\nIn your systemjs config file, map needs to tell the System loader where to look for @angular-material-extensions/google-maps-autocomplete:\n\n{\n  '@angular-material-extensions/google-maps-autocomplete';: 'node_modules/@angular-material-extensions/google-maps-autocomplete/bundles/google-maps-autocomplete.umd.js',\n}\nOnce installed you need to import the main module:\nimport { MatGoogleMapsAutocompleteModule } from '@angular-material-extensions/google-maps-autocomplete';The only remaining part is to list the imported module in your application module. The exact method will be slightly\ndifferent for the root (top-level) module for which you should end up with the code similar to (notice MatGoogleMapsAutocompleteModule.forRoot()):\nimport { AgmCoreModule } from '@agm/core';\nimport { MatGoogleMapsAutocompleteModule } from '@angular-material-extensions/google-maps-autocomplete';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [AppComponent, ...],\n  imports: [\n     // important !!!\n     AgmCoreModule.forRoot({\n          apiKey: 'YOUR_KEY',\n          libraries: ['places']\n        }),\n     MatGoogleMapsAutocompleteModule.forRoot(), ...],  \n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule {\n}Other modules in your application can simply import MatGoogleMapsAutocompleteModule:\nimport { MatGoogleMapsAutocompleteModule } from '@angular-material-extensions/google-maps-autocomplete';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [OtherComponent, ...],\n  imports: [\n     MatGoogleMapsAutocompleteModule, ...], \n})\nexport class OtherModule {\n}\n\nUsage\nAs directive\nadd matGoogleMapsAutocomplete to your target html input element to enable the google maps autocomplete api as feature\n\n  Address >\n  \nAs components\nor alternatively use mat-google-maps-auto-complete, the UI wrapper\nadd mat-google-maps-auto-complete element to your template\nmat-google-maps-auto-complete\n\n      A customized mat-google-maps-autocomplete \n\ncombine the result of the mat-google-maps-autocomplete with a google map instance via @agm\n\n\n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n      \n    \n\n  in your component, the code will be similar to --> \nimport {Component, OnInit, ViewEncapsulation} from '@angular/core';\nimport {Title} from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport {Location, Appearance, GermanAddress} from '@angular-material-extensions/google-maps-autocomplete';\nimport {} from '@types/googlemaps';\nimport PlaceResult = google.maps.places.PlaceResult;\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-home',\n  templateUrl: './home.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./home.component.scss'],\n  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None,\n})\nexport class HomeComponent implements OnInit {\n\n  public appearance = Appearance;\n  public zoom: number;\n  public latitude: number;\n  public longitude: number;\n  public selectedAddress: PlaceResult;\n\n  constructor(private titleService: Title) {\n  }\n\n  ngOnInit() {\n    this.titleService.setTitle('Home | @angular-material-extensions/google-maps-autocomplete');\n\n    this.zoom = 10;\n    this.latitude = 52.520008;\n    this.longitude = 13.404954;\n\n    this.setCurrentPosition();\n\n  }\n\n  private setCurrentPosition() {\n    if ('geolocation' in navigator) {\n      navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition((position) => {\n        this.latitude = position.coords.latitude;\n        this.longitude = position.coords.longitude;\n        this.zoom = 12;\n      });\n    }\n  }\n\n  onAutocompleteSelected(result: PlaceResult) {\n    console.log('onAutocompleteSelected: ', result);\n  }\n\n  onLocationSelected(location: Location) {\n    console.log('onLocationSelected: ', location);\n    this.latitude = location.latitude;\n    this.longitude = location.longitude;\n  }\n\n onGermanAddressMapped($event: GermanAddress) {\n    console.log('onGermanAddressMapped', $event);\n  }\n\n}\n\n\nAPI - for more info please visit the official documentation Maps JavaScript API\nmatGoogleMapsAutocomplete\n\n\n\noption\nbind\ntype\ndefault\ndescription\n\n\n\n\naddress\nInput()\nPlaceResult\nstring;\n-\n\n\ncountry\nInput()\nstring\nstring[];\n-\n\n\nplaceIdOnly\nInput()\nboolean\n-\ncan be used to instruct the Autocomplete widget to retrieve only Place IDs.
